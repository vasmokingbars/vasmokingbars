			<h1>Bar Listing Policy</h1>
			<p>
				We list any place where you may smoke and drink at the same time. In addition to the obvious, places
				like restaurants and bowling alleys can qualify as "bars." If we sense a demand, we will consider
				a category for businesses that accommodate smoking without alcohol; let us know if you would like to
				see those "bars" here as well.
			</p><p>
				Bars, smokers and drinkers are everywhere, so although we live in Virginia, we welcome listings outside
				our state.
			</p><p>
				We count on the smoking community and anyone else who still believes in freedom and apple pie to add
				listings. Unless people abuse this, we will not moderate listings. Please let us know about any
				inaccuracies you find.
			</p>
			<h2>Outdoor smoking</h2>
			<p>
				We list "outdoor smoking only" bars because they may be the smoking lush's only resort in some places.
				We do not, however, acknowledge places that force their cigarette-puffing patrons out to the street. In
				other words, they must allow you to take your drink with you to the smoking area.
